We provide our implementation and pre-trained models in this repository.

Visit our [demo page](https://tcsinger.github.io/) for audio samples.

## News
- 2024.09: We released the full dataset of [GTSinger](https://github.com/GTSinger)!
- 2024.09: TCSinger is accepted by EMNLP 2024!

## Quick Start
We provide an example of how you can generate high-fidelity samples using TCSinger.

To try on your own dataset or GTSinger, simply clone this repo in your local machine provided with NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN and follow the below instructions.

## Acknowledgements

This implementation uses parts of the code from the following Github repos:
